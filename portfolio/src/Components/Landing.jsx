          Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a post-graduate student in the
          Humber Web Development program with a passion for web development. I
          specialize in building web-based applications, with occasional design
          work. My goal is to turn my ideas into reality and create exceptional
          user experiences. I'm excited to continue learning and exploring the
          endless possibilities of the web development industry.
